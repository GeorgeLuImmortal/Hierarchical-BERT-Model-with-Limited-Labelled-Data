### Data Processing

The first step is encoding raw text data into different high-dimensional vectorised representations. The raw text data should be stored in directory "raw_corpora/", each dataset should have its individual directory, for example, the "ProtonPumpInhibitors" under folder "corpus_data". The input corpus of documents should consist of plain text files stored in csv format (two files for one corpus, one for documents belong to class A and one for documents for class B), each row corresponding to one document in that corpus, the format can be refered to the csv file in the sample directory "corpus_data/ProtonPumpInhibitors/". Then we can start convert the text into vectors:
