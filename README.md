### Step 1. Data Processing

The first step is encoding raw text data into different high-dimensional vectorised representations. The raw text data should be stored in directory __"raw_corpora/"__, each dataset should have its individual directory, for example, the "longer_moviereview/" directory under folder "raw_corpora/". The input corpus of documents should consist of plain text files stored in csv format (two files for one corpus, one for documents belong to class A and one for documents for class B) with a columan named as __text__. It should be noted that the csv file must be named in the format _#datasetname_neg_text.csv_ or _#datasetname_pos_text.csv_. Each row corresponding to one document in that corpus, the format can be refered to the csv file in the sample directory "raw_corpora/longer_moviereview/". Then we can start preprocessing text data and converting them into vectors by:

    python encode_text.py -d dataset_name -t encoding_methods
    
The options of -t are __hbm (corresponding to the outputs of token-level Roberta encoder in the paper), roberta-base and fasttext__ that represent three different representation for experiments respectively. The encoded documents are stored in directory __"dataset/"__, while the fasttext document representations are stored in __"dataset/fasttext/"__ and other representations are stored in __"dataset/roberta-base/"__. It should be noted that the sentence representations for hbm is suffixed by ".pt" and the document representations generated by roberta are suffixed by ".csv"(average all tokens to represent a document) or "\_cls.csv" (using classifier token "\<s\>" to represent a document). Due to the upload file size limit, we did not upload sample ".pt" files but you can generate yours.

### Step 2. Run Hierarchical BERT Model (HBM)
